**PROJECT 2 - MIA W.**

**WELCOME TO THE PROBABILITY AND APPLIED STATISTICS PROJECT 2 REPOSITORY!**
This repository contains documentation, CSV files, a data plotter, salter, and smoother, a formula sheet, and a stats library.

**NAVIGATION** Go through the src folder to find everything!

**CODE -**
Contains code from the updated Stats Library and a CSV file Plotter, Salter, and Smoother.

**Stats Library -** This includes a full list of the following:
Mean, median, mode, classic variance, classic standard deviation, the mn rule, permutations,
combinations, a factorial method using both Longs and BigInteger, conditional probability formulas
(both P(A|B) and P(B|A)), an independent and dependent checker, the Multiplicative Law of
Probability, the General Addition Rule Axiom, the odds of something not occurring,
the Theorem of Total Probability, Bayes Theorem, the combinatorial PMF, the Binomial Distribution PMF,
the expected value, variance, and standard deviation for binomial distribution, the Geometric
Distribution PMF, the expected value, variance, and standard deviation for geometric distribution,
the Hypergeometric Distribution PMF, the expected value, variance, and standard deviation for
hypergeometric distribution, the Negative Binomial Distribution PMF, and the expected value,
variance, and standard deviation for negative binomial distribution, Poisson distribution, the expected, variance,
and standard deviation of Poisson distribution, Tchebysheff's (or Chebyshev's) theorem, and how to calculate the k
value of Chebyshev's theorem.

**CSV Data Salter -** This folder contains programs that will plot output in a csv file (Plotter and TestPlotter),
salt the data (i.e., add "garbage" values to the data to avoid detection) by taking a csv file and updating the values
(Salter and TestSalter), then smooth the data by averaging the salted values (Smoother and TestSmoother).


**WRITTEN WORKS -**
This sections consists of documentation and a formula sheet.

Hopefully you enjoy your stay! Always remember to keep salting your data.
