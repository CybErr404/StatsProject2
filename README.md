**PROJECT 2 - MIA W.**

**WELCOME TO THE PROBABILITY AND APPLIED STATISTICS PROJECT 2 REPOSITORY!**
This repository contains documentation, CSV files, a data plotter, salter, and smoother, a formula sheet, and a stats library.

**NAVIGATION** Go through the src folder to find code related items. Go through WrittenWorks to find documentation, CSV files, and written reports.

**CODE -**
Contains code from the updated Stats Library and a CSV file Plotter, Salter, and Smoother written in Java. Along with a Java plotter, salter, and smoother,
there is a MATLAB and .jar file plotter, salter, and smoother. The MATLAB version was written after following a tutorial, and the .jar versions were created
by using .jar files downloaded from JFreeChart (https://sourceforge.net/projects/jfreechart/files/) and Apache Math Commons (https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/index.html).

**Stats Library -** This includes a full list of the following:
Poisson distribution, the expected, variance, and standard deviation of Poisson distribution, Tchebysheff's (or Chebyshev's) theorem, and how to calculate the k
value of Chebyshev's theorem.

**CSV Data Salter -** This folder contains programs that will plot output in a csv file (Plotter and TestPlotter),
salt the data (i.e., add "garbage" values to the data to avoid detection) by taking a csv file and updating the values
(Salter and TestSalter), then smooth the data by averaging the salted values (Smoother and TestSmoother).


**WRITTEN WORKS -**
This sections consists of documentation, written reports, and a formula sheet.
