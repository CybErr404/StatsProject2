**PROJECT 2 - MIA W.**

**WELCOME TO THE PROBABILITY AND APPLIED STATISTICS PROJECT 2 REPOSITORY!**
This repository contains documentation, .csv files, a data plotter, salter, and smoother, a formula sheet, and a stats library. Other programs include a MATLAB
data plotter, salter, and smoother, a .jar file plotter, salter, and smoother (one from JFreeChart and the other from Apache Commons Math), a Stock Bot to determine
when to buy or sell stocks, and a dataset paper that visualizes data from a Goodreads book dataset and tells a story about the data through statistics problems.

**NAVIGATION** Go through the src folder to find code related items. Go through WrittenWorks to find documentation, CSV files, written reports, and results.

**CODE -**
Contains code from the updated Stats Library and a .csv file Plotter, Salter, and Smoother written in Java. Along with a Java plotter, salter, and smoother,
there is a MATLAB and .jar file plotter, salter, and smoother as mentioned above. The MATLAB version was written after following a tutorial, and the .jar versions were created by using .jar files downloaded from JFreeChart (https://sourceforge.net/projects/jfreechart/files/) and Apache Commons Math (https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/index.html).

**Stats Library -** This includes a full list of the following:
Poisson distribution, the expected, variance, and standard deviation of Poisson distribution, Tchebysheff's (or Chebyshev's) theorem, how to calculate the k
value of Chebyshev's theorem, Uniform Distribution, the expected value, variance, and standard deviation of Uniform Distribution, the expected value, variance, and
standard deviation of Gamma Distribution, Exponential Distribution, the expected, variance, and standard deviation of Exponential Distribution, conditional density for
x and y values, and independency for functions, densities, probabilities, and distributions.

**CSV Data Salter -** This folder contains programs that will plot output in a csv file (Plotter and TestPlotter),
salt the data (i.e., add "garbage" values to the data to avoid detection) by taking a csv file and updating the values
(Salter and TestSalter), then smooth the data by averaging the salted values (Smoother and TestSmoother).


**WRITTEN WORKS -**
This sections consists of documentation, written reports, and a formula sheet.
